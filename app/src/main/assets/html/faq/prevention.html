                    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Prevention</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may be a candidate for preventive therapy if:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                        <li>You have four or more debilitating attacks a month</li>
                        <li>If attacks last more than 12 hours</li>
                        <li>If pain-relieving medications aren't helping</li>
                        <li>If your migraine signs and symptoms include a prolonged aura or numbness and weakness</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Preventive medications can reduce the frequency, severity and length of migraines and may increase the effectiveness of symptom-relieving medicines used during migraine attacks. It may take several weeks to see improvements in your symptoms.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your doctor may recommend daily preventive medications, or only when a predictable trigger, such as menstruation, is approaching.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Preventive medications don't always stop headaches completely, and some drugs cause serious side effects. If you have had good results from preventive medicine and your migraines are well-controlled, your doctor may recommend tapering off the medication to see if your migraines return without it.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The most common medications for migraine prevention include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            <p>
                                <strong> Cardiovascular drugs. </strong> Beta blockers, which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and coronary artery disease, may reduce the frequency and severity of migraines.
                            </p>
                            <p>The beta blockers propranolol (Inderal LA, Innopran XL, others), metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) and timolol (Betimol) have proved effective for preventing migraines. Other beta blockers are also sometimes used for treatment of migraine. You may not notice improvement in symptoms for several weeks after taking these medications.</p>
                            <p>If you're older than age 60, use tobacco, or have certain heart or blood vessel conditio ns, doctors may recommend you take a different medication.</p>
                            <p>Another class of cardiovascular medications (calcium channel blockers) used to treat high blood pressure also may be helpful in preventing migraines and relieving symptoms. Verapamil (Calan, Verelan, others) is a calcium channel blocker that may help prevent migraines with aura.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (Zestril) may be useful in reducing the length and severity of migraines.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">

                                <strong> Antidepressants. </strong> Tricyclic antidepressants may be effective in preventing migraines, even in people without depression.
                            </p>
                            <p>Tricyclic antidepressants may reduce the frequency of migraines by affecting the level of serotonin and other brain chemicals. Amitriptyline is the only tricyclic antidepressant proved to effectively prevent migraines. Other tricyclic antidepressants are sometimes used because they may have fewer side effects than amitriptyline.</p>
                            <p>These medications can cause sleepiness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain and other side effects.</p>
                            <p>Another class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors hasn't been proved to be effective for migraine prevention. These drugs may even worsen or trigger headaches.</p>
                            <p>However, research suggests that one serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine (Effexor XR), may be helpful in preventing migraines.</p>

                        <li style="text-align: justify;">

                                <strong> Anti-seizure drugs. </strong> Some anti-seizure drugs, such as valproate (Depacon) and topiramate (Topamax), seem to reduce the frequency of migraines.
                            </p>
                            <p>In high doses, however, these anti-seizure drugs may cause side effects. Valproate sodium may cause nausea, tremor, weight gain, hair loss and dizziness. Valproate products should not be used in pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.</p>
                            <p>Topiramate may cause diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, memory difficulties and concentration problems.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            <p>
                                <strong> OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). </strong> OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) has been shown to be helpful in treating chronic migraines in adults.
                            </p>
                            <p>During this procedure, onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into the muscles of the forehead and neck. When this is effective, the treatment usually needs to be repeated every 12 weeks.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            <strong> Pain relievers. </strong> Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially naproxen (Naprosyn), may help prevent migraines and reduce symptoms.
