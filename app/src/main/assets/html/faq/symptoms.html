        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Symptoms</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Migraines often begin in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. Migraines may progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, headache and post-drome, though you may not experience all stages.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Prodrome</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">One or two days before a migraine, you may notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>Constipation</li>
            <li>Mood changes, from depression to euphoria</li>
            <li>Food cravings</li>
            <li>Neck stiffness</li>
            <li>Increased thirst and urination</li>
            <li>Frequent yawning</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Aura</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Aura may occur before or during migraines. Most people experience migraines without aura.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Auras are symptoms of the nervous system. They are usually visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or wavy, zigzag vision.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes auras can also be touching sensations (sensory), movement (motor) or speech (verbal) disturbances. Your muscles may get weak, or you may feel as though someone is touching you.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Each of these symptoms usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and lasts for 20 to 60 minutes. Examples of migraine aura include:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light</li>
            <li>Vision loss</li>
            <li>Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg</li>
            <li>Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body</li>
            <li>Difficulty speaking</li>
            <li>Hearing noises or music</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable jerking or other movements</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, a migraine with aura may be associated with limb weakness (hemiplegic migraine).</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Attack</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A migraine usually lasts from four to 72 hours if untreated. The frequency with which headaches occur varies from person to person. Migraines may be rare, or strike several times a month. During a migraine, you may experience:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>Pain on one side or both sides of your head</li>
            <li>Pain that feels throbbing or pulsing</li>
            <li>Sensitivity to light, sounds, and sometimes smells and touch</li>
            <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Post-drome</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The final phase, known as post-drome, occurs after a migraine attack. You may feel drained and washed out, while some people feel elated. For about 24 hours, you may also experience:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>Confusion</li>
            <li>Moodiness</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
            <li>Weakness</li>
            <li>Sensitivity to light and sound</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify;">When to see a doctor</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Migraines are often undiagnosed and untreated. If you regularly experience signs and symptoms of migraine attacks, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them. Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> See your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room </strong> if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which may indicate a more serious medical problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Headache with fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or trouble speaking</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">New headache pain if you're older than 50</li>
        </ul>
