    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Complications</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes your efforts to control your migraine pain cause problems, such as:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>
            <strong> Abdominal problems. </strong> Certain pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may cause abdominal pain, bleeding, ulcers and other complications, especially if taken in large doses or for a long period of time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong> Medication-overuse headaches. </strong> Taking over-the-counter or prescription headache medications more than 10 days a month for three months or in high doses may trigger serious medication-overuse headaches.
            </p>
            <p>Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches. You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong> Serotonin syndrome. </strong> Serotonin syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when your body has too much of the nervous system chemical called serotonin.
            </p>
            <p>While the risk is considered extremely low, taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. These medications naturally raise serotonin levels, and it is possible that combining them could cause levels that are too high.</p>
            <p>Triptans and SSRIs or SNRIs may be used together, but it's important to watch out for possible symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as changes in cognition, behavior and muscle control (such as involuntary jerking).</p>
            <p>Triptans include medications such as sumatriptan (Imitrex) or zolmitriptan (Zomig). Some common SSRIs include sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Sarafem, Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil). SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, some people experience complications from migraines such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Chronic migraine. </strong> If your migraine lasts for 15 or more days a month for more than three months, you have chronic migraine.
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Status migrainosus. </strong> People with this complication have severe migraine attacks that last for longer than three days.
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Persistent aura without infarction. </strong> Usually an aura goes away after the migraine attack, but sometimes aura lasts for more than one week afterward. A persistent aura may have similar symptoms to bleeding in the brain (stroke), but without signs of bleeding in the brain, tissue damage or other problems.
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Migrainous infarction. </strong> Aura symptoms that last longer than one hour can signal a loss of blood supply to an area of the brain (stroke), and should be evaluated. Doctors can conduct neuroimaging tests to identify bleeding in the brain.
        </li>
    </ul>
