    <p style="text-align: justify;">Several factors make you more prone to having migraines, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Family history. </strong> If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too.
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Age. </strong> Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence. Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades.
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Sex. </strong> Women are three times more likely to have migraines. Headaches tend to affect boys more than girls during childhood, but by the time of puberty and beyond, more girls are affected.

        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong> Hormonal changes. </strong> If you are a woman who has migraines, you may find that your headaches begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation.They may also change during pregnancy or menopause. Migraines generally improve after menopause.Some women report that migraine attacks begin during pregnancy, or their attacks worsen. For many, the attacks improved or didn't occur during later stages in the pregnancy. Migraines often return during the postpartum period.
